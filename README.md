My To-Do List Web App
A simple and dynamic To-Do List web application built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project allows users to add, mark as complete, and remove tasks from their list, providing a seamless and interactive user experience without page reloads.

Remove Tasks: Delete tasks from the list permanently.
Instant UI Updates: All actions (add, complete, remove) update the user interface instantly without requiring a page reload.
Responsive Design: Basic styling ensures the app looks decent on various screen sizes.
Vanilla JavaScript: Built purely with plain JavaScript, demonstrating core DOM manipulation and event handling skills.
🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: For the basic structure and content of the web page.
